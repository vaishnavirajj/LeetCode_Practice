# LeetCode_Practice
This is where I solve Leetcode problems daily, focusing on easy, medium, and hard problems to sharpen my problem-solving skills and prepare for placements.

## Why This Repository?
I believe consistent practice is the key to success in coding interviews. By solving problems daily, I aim to improve my coding efficiency, learn new techniques, and get accustomed to a variety of problem types.

## Structure
- **Daily Problems**: Each day, I will solve at least one problem from each of the following categories:
  - Easy
  - Medium
  - Hard

- **Problem Solutions**: The solutions are categorized into folders based on difficulty. Each solution will include:
  - The problem statement.
  - My solution code.
  - Explanations or comments where necessary.

- **Languages Used**: I will be primarily using C++,Java.

## How to Use This Repository
Feel free to browse through the solutions for reference or revision. If you are also preparing for placements, you can follow along and attempt the problems yourself before looking at the solutions.

## Future Plans
- Add more advanced topics like dynamic programming, graph algorithms, etc.
- Regularly update the repository with more problems as I progress.
